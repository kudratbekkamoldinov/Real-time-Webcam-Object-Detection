# Real-time Webcam Object Detection

This repository contains the code for a real-time object detection system that uses webcam feed integrated with TensorFlow's Object Detection API. The project applies advanced computer vision techniques to detect and classify objects in a live video stream.

## Overview

The project is designed to demonstrate the practical application of deep learning models in real-time scenarios. By utilizing the webcam, the model identifies objects in the video feed and classifies them with their bounding boxes.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to install TensorFlow and other dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python-headless
```

## Usage

To run the object detection on your webcam feed, execute the following command:

```bash
python Webcam_Object_Detection.py
```

The script will access your webcam and start the object detection process. Detected objects will be displayed with bounding boxes in the live feed.

## Features

- Real-time object detection in video streams.
- Utilizes TensorFlow's Object Detection API for accurate classification.
- Easy-to-use with minimal setup required.
